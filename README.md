# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this script is to add on what we have made already. One addition is weather descriptions so we can see the potential forecast of the city. Using this script we can filter the data based on the weather and build an itinerary from that data. When the itinerary is created, we can create a travel route and a marker layer map using Google Maps Directions API.
